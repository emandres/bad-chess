Bad Chess is a refactoring and testing kata, inspired by the likes of [Gilded Rose](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata)
and [Tennis Refactoring](https://github.com/emilybache/Tennis-Refactoring-Kata).

The company, ChequeMayte, has hired an outsourcing firm to build the brains of a chess program. In typical fashion, we paid 100% of the fee, got 80% of the features we asked for, and then were ghosted.
You and your team are now tasked with bringing the code in house and making it your own. The developer guaranteed there were [no bugs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzL10mgudaU)
Unfortunately, the nerds who use your software disagree. Some nonsense about Rooks not working, blah blah blah.

The code is available in either C# or Javascript.
